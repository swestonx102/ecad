Dumpster Divers throw it up

lmao you know I actually kinda
like Faygo

in philly they only sold the
pineapple kind cuz it is the 
go-to lean mixer in philly

lmao one of my friends found
a full bottle of Activis
in a dumpster once
oh jeez oh man i wonder what
the story is there


well timed dumpster diving

i mean for whoever deposited it
there

I dont like to think much about
it

fair enough


you gotta start using vim

counterpoint-
maybe no

but it is good

all the fun of nano plus 

R E G U L A R E X P R E S S I O N S

you know
I thought I was comfortable enough
with just a no
but considering that now
I did not think there was actually
an argument that would make me
want to use it less

regex and I literally got into
a fist fight last night

Oh my god
what were you working on

YOU DIDNT EDIT THE MIRROR FILE

THAT'S WHY THIS IS TAKING SO LONG

i guess this is why we can't have
nice things

GRUB Is why

ALMOST THEEEERE

gotta edit that damb mirror file

aaand we're back to the superbowl
it took 1 minute 20 seconds
last time

because i edited the mirror file

we are downloading shit from
BULGARIA

MACEDONIA

ECUADOR

KAZAKHSTAN

ISRAEL

zimbabwe

is there a zimbabwe???

idk but as long as the
mirror isnt in Georgia

the country or the state

lmao I have a story about that
that might freak you out a lil

virus?

oh do you know the band virus

THAT KEEPS HAPPENING WHEN I GO 
ON YOUTUBE

maybe something to do with dns?

iunno we can poke around


it's not DNS, it's UMass using 
GApps

So it goes on /dev/sda because
that's the disk itself and
the bootloader interprets
the operating system on the
partition?

you point grub towards the partition
block that arch is installed on

actually I'm gonna
hold off on talking about that
it's been forever since I've done
a dual boot and I don't wanna
explain something incorrectly
don't really remember

i mean

in windows, the bootloader is 
on
a
separate partition?
innit?

the MSDOS bootloader or whatever?

I'm not sure, I'm best at nix
I haven't even mained Win in
pretty much a year

it's ok windows sucks

hard agree,
gonna wrap this up rq
we're almost done with install
and can move on to gui
